<h2><a href="https://combarriers.givezooks.com/events/poverty-race-and-consciousness">Poverty, Race, and Consciousness</a></h2>
<p>RACE: In the 40+ years since the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, we continue to see our neighbors 
struggle for equal rights, access, and opportunities. What will it take for us to live in a society free from discrimination?</p>

<p>POVERTY: In the 1700s, poverty was made illegal and/or thought to be a character flaw. Today, many people living in the 
crisis of poverty continue to be punished for poverty conditions. Many efforts to eradicate poverty fail or at best assist 
people to “cope” with current poverty conditions. What can we do to ensure our neighbors are moving out and staying out of the 
war zone of poverty?</p>

<p>CONSCIOUSNESS: Our society reflects the state of our consciousness. What do you know and believe about race issues and or 
poverty issues? Can we transform our collective consciousness and create communities that work for all?</p>

<p>In this training, participants will:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Explore the intersection of race and class</li>
	<li>Examine how subconscious bias gets in the way of breaking barriers</li>
	<li>Learn practical doable strategies to eliminate racism and poverty.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>This session provides individuals, organizations, communities, and our nation with practical, usable tools to overcome 
these barriers. Let’s come together to create the kinds of communities where everyone reaches their fullest potential.</p>
